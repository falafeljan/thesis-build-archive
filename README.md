# Thesis Build Archive

Want to access your recent (automated) LaTeX builds while on the go? This is a simple, static website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that's receiving PDF builds via CI environments, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/dashboard). For each added PDF file committed, the static build step will keep the _n_ newest builds and generate static metadata. 

### Usage

Get started by running `npm install` with Node.js `v13` or newer. To be continued.
